## The purpose of this repo
- The purpose is to develop small projects in order to develop competence in C and then move on to larger and more complex projects.

## Advantages of C:
- Efficient and fast
    - Lets you work with memory at a low level, making it ideal for application that require speed and economical resource usage
- Portable
    - C programs can be compiled and executed on different platforms with little to no changes
    - This is due to C being a standardised language and compilers being made available for use on various OSs globally
- Close to hardware
    - Suitable for applications that require fine control over hardware resources
- Standard libraries
    - C comes with a large standard library which helps developers code efficiently with preexisting functions
- Structured programming
    - C helps organise code into modular structures, making it easier to maintain
- Procedural language
    - C follows a procedural paradigm that is often simpler for some types of programming tasks
