## The purpose of this repo
- The purpose is to develop small projects in order to develop competence in C and then move on to larger and more complex projects.

## Advantages of C:
- Efficient and fast
    - Lets you work with memory at a low level, making it ideal for applications that require speed and economical resource usage
- Portable
    - C programs can be compiled and executed on different platforms with little to no changes
    - This is due to C being a standardised language and compilers being made available for use on various OSs globally
- Close to hardware
    - Suitable for applications that require fine control over hardware resources
- Standard libraries
    - C comes with a large standard library which helps developers code efficiently with preexisting functions
- Structured programming
    - C helps organise code into modular structures, making it easier to maintain
- Procedural language
    - C follows a procedural paradigm that is often simpler for some types of programming tasks
 
## Disadvantages of C:
- Manual memory management
    - Memory needs to be manually allocated and deallocated
- No Object-oriented feature
    - Most programming languages today support OOP features but C doesn't
    - This can be a drawback in some cases but not in others 
- No garbage collection
    - Garbage collection is not supported
    - Memory needs to be manually allocated and deallocated which can lead to errors and ultimately memory leaks or inefficient use of memory
- No exception handling
    - C does not provide libraries for handling exceptions therefore it needs to be done manually
